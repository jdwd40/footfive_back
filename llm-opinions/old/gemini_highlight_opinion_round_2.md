After reviewing the opinions from all three language models, there is a strong consensus on the core problems and the ideal solution.

**Key Design Limitations Identified by All:**

*   **Unsuitability for Live Display:** The core challenge is that the existing system, with its intentional delays and post-match processing, is not designed for a live score experience. The "clock sync issue" is a symptom of this fundamental limitation.
*   **Lack of Realism and Narrative:** The "one event per minute" rule and disconnected nature of highlights prevent the system from creating a compelling, realistic narrative suitable for a live match.

**Unified Solution for a Live-Ready System:**

All three proposals converge on an event-driven architecture as the solution. The backend simulator should generate a stream of structured, causally-linked events (an "attack chain"), and the frontend should be responsible for interpreting and displaying them with the correct timing. This new architecture is the key to enabling a true live score feature and moving beyond the limitations of the old system.

**The Best Way Forward:**

Claude's proposal is the most detailed and provides a clear, phased implementation plan. I recommend we adopt its strategy.

Here is the proposed plan:

1.  **Initial Improvement (Low-Hanging Fruit):**
    *   As a first step, we can improve the existing "slow-sim" feature by moving the clock update to occur *when the highlight is displayed*, not when it's scheduled. While this doesn't enable a true live experience, it makes the existing replay more realistic and is a good first step.

2.  **Short-Term (Foundation for the New System):**
    *   Next, I will begin refactoring `MatchSimulator.js` to introduce the concept of **event chains** using a `chainId`.
    *   I will remove the "one event per minute" constraint to allow for more dynamic sequences.
    *   I will introduce a few high-impact new event types like `corner`, `near-miss`, and `counter-attack`.

This approach delivers an immediate improvement to the user experience while setting the stage for the full architectural redesign required for a live score system.
