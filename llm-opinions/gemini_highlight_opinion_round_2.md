After reviewing the opinions from all three language models, there is a strong consensus on the core problems and the ideal solution.

**Key Problems Identified by All:**

*   **Clock Sync Issue:** The fundamental bug is that the UI clock updates when an event is *processed*, not when it's *displayed*.
*   **Unrealistic Simulation:** The "one event per minute" rule is artificial and prevents realistic match flow.
*   **Lack of Narrative:** Highlights are disconnected, lacking the "story" of an attack (e.g., build-up → shot → goal).

**Unified Solution:**

All three proposals converge on an event-driven architecture. The backend simulator should generate a stream of structured, causally-linked events (an "attack chain"), and the frontend should be responsible for interpreting and displaying them with the correct timing. This not only fixes the clock bug but also creates a more realistic and scalable system.

**The Best Way Forward:**

Claude's proposal is the most detailed and provides a clear, phased implementation plan. I recommend we adopt its strategy.

Here is the proposed plan:

1.  **Immediate Fix (Low-Hanging Fruit):**
    *   First, I will fix the clock synchronization bug in `app.js` by moving the clock update to occur *when the highlight is displayed*, not when it's scheduled. This provides an immediate improvement with minimal effort.

2.  **Short-Term (Foundation for the New System):**
    *   Next, I will begin refactoring `MatchSimulator.js` to introduce the concept of **event chains** using a `chainId`.
    *   I will remove the "one event per minute" constraint to allow for more dynamic sequences.
    *   I will introduce a few high-impact new event types like `corner`, `near-miss`, and `counter-attack`.

This approach delivers an immediate fix for the most critical bug while setting the stage for the full architectural redesign.
