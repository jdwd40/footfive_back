## Match Logic Explanation

### Why You Don't See Many Extra Time/Penalties

The MatchSimulator uses **realistic knockout tournament logic**:

1. **Regular Time** (90 minutes):
   - Most matches are decided here
   - Only goes to extra time if **scores are TIED** after 90 minutes

2. **Extra Time** (91-120 minutes):
   - Only triggered if match is tied after 90 minutes
   - 30 additional minutes to find a winner
   - Only goes to penalties if **still tied** after extra time

3. **Penalty Shootout**:
   - Only triggered if match is still tied after 120 minutes
   - 5 penalties each team, then sudden death if needed

### Probability Analysis

In a typical championship with 16 teams:

- **Round of 16** (8 matches): Expect ~1-2 extra time/penalties
- **Quarter-Finals** (4 matches): Expect ~0-1 extra time/penalties  
- **Semi-Finals** (2 matches): Expect ~0-1 extra time/penalties
- **Final** (1 match): ~25-30% chance of extra time

This is actually **realistic**! In real knockout tournaments:
- Most matches (70-80%) are decided in regular time
- Extra time occurs in ~15-25% of matches
- Penalty shootouts occur in ~5-10% of matches

### Factors That Increase Extra Time/Penalties

Matches are more likely to go to extra time when:
1. **Teams are evenly matched** (similar attack/defense ratings)
2. **Both teams have strong defense** (lower scoring probability)
3. **Both teams have good goalkeepers** (more saves)

### Testing Extra Time/Penalties

To see more extra time matches, you could:
1. **Simulate multiple championships** - probability will average out
2. **Look for evenly matched teams** - teams with similar overall ratings
3. **Check the Final** - single elimination finals often go to extra time

## How to Test the Updates

1. **Refresh your browser** to load the updated JavaScript
2. **Start a new championship**
3. **Simulate rounds** and watch for tied matches
4. **Check result displays** - you'll now see clear indicators:
   - Regular time: Just the score
   - Extra time: Info badge
   - Penalties: Penalty score with warning badge

## Technical Details

### Detection Method
```javascript
const hadExtraTime = match.highlights.some(h => 
    h.type === 'extraTimeStart' || 
    h.type === 'extraTimeHalf' || 
    h.type === 'extraTimeEnd'
);

const hadPenalties = match.highlights.some(h => 
    h.type === 'penaltyShootout'
);
```

The code checks the match highlights to determine if extra time or penalties occurred, ensuring accurate display of match progression.

### Winner Determination
- **Penalties**: Winner based on penalty shootout score
- **Extra Time**: Winner based on final score after extra time
- **Regular Time**: Winner based on 90-minute score

All logic now correctly handles tie-breaking scenarios!
